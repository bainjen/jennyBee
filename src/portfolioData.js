      "This project is designed to help farmers evaluate autonomous combine (harvesting tractor) performance. Users can specify auger length, fuel type, and a wheel size to create a combine. Once a configuration is added, a simulation test fires every hour to measure the time that each particular combine takes to plane a 10 x 10 acre field, the percentage of the field covered, and the cost of the run. The efficiency value of each simulation run is averaged to make an overall efficiency measure for each combine configuration. ",

      "Using AWS and GraphQL were completely new experiences for me. I realize I've only just begun to understand their potential and I look forward to exploring this more. I also learned how context can be used in React to make data easily accessible within nested components.",

      "I had the honour of collaborating with two fantastic members of my cohort and enjoyed learning good communication and teamwork habits. We faced the unique challenge of integrating an imperative framework (Phaser) into a declarative framework (React) which gave me a deeper understanding of the pros and cons of these two types of programming languages. This project also opened my eyes to the limitless potential of creativity and imagination within the world of programming and has inspired me to include happy details for users in every corner of code.",

      "I co-built this project with a partner as a mid-term assignment during boot camp. It was a phenomenal experience working with and learning from another person. Both of us grappled with and gained a better understanding of how RESTful APIs work to organize the flow of an app. It also helped me to better understand how a full-stack application shares data between the database, back-end server, and front-end.
