      "This project is designed to help farmers evaluate autonomous combine (harvesting tractor) performance. Users can specify auger length, fuel type, and a wheel size to create a combine. Once a configuration is added, a simulation test fires every hour to measure the time that each particular combine takes to plane a 10 x 10 acre field, the percentage of the field covered, and the cost of the run. The efficiency value of each simulation run is averaged to make an overall efficiency measure for each combine configuration. ",

      "Using AWS and GraphQL were completely new experiences for me. I realize I've only just begun to understand their potential and I look forward to exploring this more. I also learned how context can be used in React to make data easily accessible within nested components.",

We faced the unique challenge of integrating an imperative framework such as Phaser into React, which is a declarative framework. This project opened my eyes to the limitless potential of creativity and imagination within the world of programming and has inspired me to include happy details for users in every corner of code.",
