      "This project is designed to help farmers evaluate autonomous combine (harvesting tractor) performance. Users can specify auger length, fuel type, and a wheel size to create a combine. Once a configuration is added, a simulation test fires every hour to measure the time that each particular combine takes to plane a 10 x 10 acre field, the percentage of the field covered, and the cost of the run. The efficiency value of each simulation run is averaged to make an overall efficiency measure for each combine configuration.",
