## Hello, nice to meet you :)

The rumors are true: This is my fourth blog, fifth if we're including my Xanga (R.I.P. 2002-2005).

My last three blogs were kept primarily to satiate my family's desire for proof that I was ~~surviving~~ thriving while living abroad. They detailed my quotidienne existence as I did embarassing things in unfamiliar places such as chasing down the midnight bus with an open pan of Jell-o underarm or, accidentally inviting myself to a stranger's family birthday party at a bowling alley. The posts served as reassurnce to both me and my beloved, that things were _more-or-less fine_.

None of those blogs exist anymore, which is probably for the best. And while the great quarantine of 2020 kept me from getting myself into situational trouble with the outside world, it did push me into an entirely different kind of adventure into the great uknown: **web development**.

It only feels right to keep a blog where I recount my hopes, dreams, experiments, and blunders in this new frontier of mine. Here are some ~reasons~ why:

## I've learned a lot reading blogs

## I hope you can learn something from me

## At the very least, I hope you can laugh with me

## I hope this will also help me to process things, too
