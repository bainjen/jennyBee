From August to Novemeber of 2020, I threw myself fully into the vast world of programming via a 12 week web development bootcamp.

During this time, I learned the practical skills to build full stack web applications through daily lectures from instructors, one-on-one guidance with professional mentors, and coursework that progressively challenged me to apply new knowledge to building real web applications both indepednently and with my peers.

The days were long, the nights were short, and the bags under my eyes were prominent. It was a wild ride! I may have emerged from my ~~troll cave~~ cacoon with a hunched back from straining at a screen 14 hours a day. But in that whirlwind, three month timeframe I also progressed in ways I never imagined possible, prepared to start a new career.

### So, would you do it again?

Yes. Undoubdetly. It was a good choice for me!

### Should I do it?

That depends! Everyone is different.

Let's discuss a few things and hopefully this will provide you with the ammunition needed to make the right decision for you.

## Bootcamp: What is it?

_Just to clarify, there are many uses for the term 'bootcamp'.In the case of this blog post, I am referring specifically to a **full stack web development bootcamp** because this is the only kind of bootcamp I have personal expereince completing. You will not be finding me in any military or fitness bootcamps any time soon._ ðŸ˜…

A web development bootcamp is a program that efficiently teaches participants the technical and programming skills necessary to find employment as an entry level web developer.

Bootcamps are often geared toward students with limited or no formal technical background. However, you will find a variety of students enrolled in bootcamps, each with their own motivations! There are no hard and fast rules about who can take a bootcamp, as long as you are old enough and meet program qualifications.

These programs tend to focus on building foundational skills that bring students up to speed quickly so they can apply newly acquired knowledge directly to building applications that emmulate real buisness solutions. The goal is for students to get enough real-life programming experience to land an entry level job where they can continue their learning process as they work.

## Why Bootcamp?

There are many other ways to learn programming skills and completing a bootcamp is only one option.

For example, a person could complere a bachelor's degree in computer science, earn an associate's degree or certificate from a two year technical institute, or take advantage of the plentiful (and often free!) resources available online to learn programming languages and skills.

## Here are some factors to consider when deciding which path to choose:

#### Time

Bootcamps usually range from 2-4 months completion time. That's roughly one semester of school. This is quick, especially compared to a four year degree!

Don't get me wrong: I love school and I love learning. ðŸ¤“
Nonetheless, when I thought of giving up YEARS of my life to go back to school at the age of 30, it gave me heart palpitations. Converseley, the consideration of alotting a few months? I could do that.

The caveat? While one semester is a relatively short period of time, bootcamp is all-encompassing. In my expereince, I did not have the free time to keep up with my social life or hobbies as a bootcamp student. And while I technically worked a part time job teaching English classes in the mornings before lectures began, this is not recommended. I relied very heavily on my partner to care for our pets, cook meals, and keep our apartment in shape. I also notified my close friends and family ahead of time that I wouldn't be as available as I normally am. For three full months, everything else went on the back burner and my whole world was about learning to code well.

On that note, let's move to the next consideration: ðŸ¤‘

#### Money

There's a pretty clear heirarchy on the cost spectrum:

```
online resrouces  <  bootcamp  <  technical institute  <  4 year degree
```

Learning online is the cheapest way to upskill while a Bachelor's Degree will be the most expensive option that keeps you away from full-time employment the longest.

Perhaps you are a recent high school grad and looking to spend some time in school gaining a deeper wealth of knowledge regardless? A degree program might be a good choice, allowing you to take courses in both computer science and other areas of study that interest you.

If maintaining a job is a must (I fully acknowledge that I had the priviledge of relying on my partner's full-time job to carry us through my bootcamp unemployemnt period!), I'd recommend getting started learning online with free resources first, or enrolling in a part-time program.

Regardless, it's important to weigh the cost of the program in consideration against the amount of money you'll be able to earn during that time period. This looks different for everyone.

#### Learning Style

When I first thought about learning to code, I used free online resources. They allowed me to learn in my spare time, at my own pace. And for me, that turned out ot be part of the problem. It seems when faced with the option to go to triva on a Tuesday night with my friends or sit down to learn to code, I chose trivia.

#### Job Prospects

#### Personal Life

## Still not sure what to do?

My choice to enroll in a bootcamp hinged on the simple fact that it was quicker and less expensive than a degree program.
